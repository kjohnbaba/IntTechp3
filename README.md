# HTTP Server with Authentication

Implemented an HTTP server that serves secret user data. Access to this secret
data will be authenticated through one of two mechanisms: (i) user name and password, and (ii)
cookies presented from successful prior authentication. We will use the HTTP protocol and build
simple versions of these authentication mechanisms to render browser-readable data
